# This will be my project diary starting from today...

## Day-1(SEPT 29,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;11:20-attempting to implement cellular automata for cave generation  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;04:02-successfully implemented cellular automata  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;04:43-found out that cellular automata results in isolated/floating islands.attempting to remove them  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:04-the cave entrances are too narrow and there are no proper pathways for the player to walk around.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thinking of implementing a **grappling hook** for cave traversal or implementing **wall jumps** for the player  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:25-implemented widening of narrow vertical gaps.need to widen horizontal and diagonal gaps aswell  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:46-**end of day**  

## Day-2(SEPT 30,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;09:44-start  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;09:38(pm)-forgot to commit and closed the browser.notes lost.time wasted.still trying to properly implement tunneling and random walk  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10:38-end 0f day  

## Day-3(OCT 1,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10:02-start  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;12:11-implemented tunnel entrance.moving on to tunnel room generation  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;03:03-implemented tunnel room generation along with a 2nd tunnel system.moving on to making the 2nd entrance  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:33-implemented multi tunnel system with entrance generation.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;07:39- modularized map generation and trying to implement flood fill for loot assignment.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;08:02-end of day  

## Day-4(OCT 2,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;06:56-no work done due to festival

## Day-5(OCT 3,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;09:56-start  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;11:28-retrying to implement flood fill for loot assignment  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;02:23-retrying to implement flood fill for loot assignment  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:21-successfully implemented flood fill for loot assignment  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;06:02-end of day
