# This will be my project diary starting from today...

## Day-1(SEPT 29,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;11:20-attempting to implement cellular automata for cave generation  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;04:02-successfully implemented cellular automata  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;04:43-found out that cellular automata results in isolated/floating islands.attempting to remove them  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:04-the cave entrances are too narrow and there are no proper pathways for the player to walk around.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;thinking of implementing a **grappling hook** for cave traversal or implementing **wall jumps** for the player  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:25-implemented widening of narrow vertical gaps.need to widen horizontal and diagonal gaps aswell  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;05:46-**end of day**  

## Day-2(SEPT 30,2025):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;09:44-start  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;09:38(pm)-forgot to commit and closed the browser.notes lost.time wasted.still trying to properly implement tunneling and random walk
